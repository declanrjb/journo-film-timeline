                    <p><a class="film-tag">His Girl Friday</a>, directed by Howard Hawks, is a zany 1940s comedy starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as snide divorcees Walter and Hildy that happen to work for the same newspaper. Hildy is primed to retire and begin a life with her new husband; Walter desperately wants her back and knows all of her weak spots, especially her vulnerability to a good story. What follows from there is a fast-paced whirlwind of murderers, policemen, mothers-in-law, corrupt local government, counterfeit money, and extortion. <i>His Girl Friday</i> is one of the most famous journalism movies of all time, and for good reason - it deftly explores themes such as exploitation in the industry, misogyny, and the power compelling journalism possesses to sway the public.</p>
