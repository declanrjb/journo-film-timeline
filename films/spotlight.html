                            <p>Spotlight, based on a real story, follows the four reporters on The Boston Globe’s investigative reporting team, Spotlight, as they uncover a large network of child abuse by Catholic priests that has been systemically covered up by the church. What starts as a small story covering one case slowly builds up as the Spotlight team uncovers a decades-long cover up and enabling of abusive priests by the Church through transferring the priests to different locations.</p>

                            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                            <p>Spotlight was released in 2015, at a point in time in which American’s trust in institutions, including the press, had been in decline for some time. While the film still generally presents a positive vision of journalism, providing somewhat of a countering vision to the increasing feelings of distrust that many Americans had about the press, those attitudes of distrust seem to have influenced the film. The film depicts many institutions as corrupted and not functioning as they should, including the press, to a small extent. For example, the film opens with a scene of the police covering up a priest's sexual abuse of children, clearly showing an institution being complicit in the Catholic church’s coverup and perpetuation of abuse. The judicial system is also complicit, as Mike Rezendes, one of the reporters, encounters trouble and obstruction in finding public documents detailing how important officials in the church were aware of the abuse.</p>
                            <p>There’s more: Eric MacLeish, a lawyer who has dealt with many victims of abuse by priests, settles cases directly with the church, rather than through the judicial system, which would be incredibly damaging to the church. Officials of a Catholic school try to convince the reporters that the leadership hadn’t known about the abuse, even when it’s clear that they probably did. Even Walter Robinson, the journalist leading the investigative team, had been previously complicit in the coverup, as many years ago, he had gotten a list of 20 priests who had sexually abused kids, but didn’t investigate further and instead downplayed the story. Notably, this wasn’t discovered until the making of the film, but the filmmakers included it in the film anyway, further indicating that the filmmakers did want to show the audience that all these different institutions, including even the press itself, had been complicit in covering up this abuse, reflecting Americans’ increasing distrust in institutions.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, the film at several points implies and even once explicitly says that you need an outsider to expose this institutional corruption: the investigation is started at the behest of the new editor of the Boston Globe, Marty Baron, who at times in the movie is looked down upon by other characters because he’s not from Boston, and the one lawyer who’s taking abuse cases public, Mitchell Garabedian, is an Armenian, unlike pretty much all the inhabitants of Boston. And this is also indicative of the American mood at the time, and indeed, even today: just look at how many people support, for example, political outsiders who aren’t part of the “establishment”, as trust in government and institutions continues to go down.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Impact of journalism on journalists: how Rezendes had wanted to go back to church at some point, but now can’t because of what they’ve uncovered, Matt Carroll finds “treatment center” near his house</li>
                                <li>Releasing story now, or getting more information: after finding a letter written to Cardinal Law about abuse that Law ignored, Mike Rezendes wants to release the story now, but Walter Robinson wants to not rush and instead get more information before releasing it</li>
                                <li>Institutional complicity: a lot of different institutions are complicit in helping the catholic church cover up the abuse</li>
                                <li>Righting the wrongs of the past: how clips of past Boston Globe articles were never followed up until now, how Eric Macliesh sent 20 guilty priests to the Globe but it was ignored by Robby. But they’re telling the story now.</li>
                                <li>Listening to survivors: Phil Saviano, leader of an organization of abuse survivors, was ignored by the globe 5 years prior to the Spotlight team’s investigation, and the editors were not eager to hear him out.</li>
                                <li>Needing outsiders to investigate: the Spotlight team only starts this investigation after Marty Baron, the new editor who isn’t from the area, tells them to</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Both movies show the heroic side of journalism, with Woodward and Bernstein trying to uncover the truth of Watergate, and the Spotlight crew trying to uncover the truth of the Catholic church.</li>
                                <li>There’s this frustration of knowing what’s true, wanting to tell the world, but not having all the information to strongly back everything up.</li>
                                <li>The personal effects the work of journalism has on people. When we look into Woodward’s apartment, everything is covered in the work of the newspaper. At one point, because the information they have is top secret, they put on loud music and communicate through a typewriter to decide their next move, in case they are being bugged by government security.</li>
                                <li>Spotlight doesn’t necessarily show the dangers, but it shows the personal nature of the way journalism can strike you, which is evident in Rezendez’s breakdown.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The big contrast with this movie is care. Lou Bloom, the main character in Nightcrawler, does not seem to care about the people he is documenting. He just cares about getting the right shot for ratings.</li>
                                <li>In contrast, the journalists in Spotlight are very gentle with the victims of the Catholic church. In one scene where Sasha Pifefer is interviewing Joe, a victim, she uses very reassuring language with him to get the story out, and she tells him that it’s okay when he gets emotional.</li>
                                <li>We don’t see this with Nightcrawler, in fact, we see him do quite the opposite. We see the crux of his lack of empathy when he deliberately gets his partner killed, and then just starts filming him as he’s dying.</li>
                                <li>Whereas, Marty Baron, Boston Globe editor, says that this kind of story, the kind that uncovers the truth about the Catholic church, that lets victims’ stories be heard, “is why we do this.”</li>
