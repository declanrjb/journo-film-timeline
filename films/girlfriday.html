                        <h2>About the Film</h2>
                        <p>His Girl Friday, directed by Howard Hawks, is a zany 1940s comedy starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as snide divorcees Walter and Hildy that happen to work for the same newspaper. Hildy is primed to retire and begin a life with her new husband; Walter desperately wants her back and knows all of her weak spots, especially her vulnerability to a good story. What follows from there is a fast-paced whirlwind of murderers, policemen, mothers-in-law, corrupt local government, counterfeit money, and extortion. His Girl Friday is one of the most famous journalism movies of all time, and for good reason - it deftly explores themes such as exploitation in the industry, misogyny, and the power compelling journalism possesses to sway the public.</p>
                        <h2>Journalistic Themes</h2>
                        <p>In His Girl Friday, journalism is both a constructive and destructive force. Walter and Hildy are capable of liberating an innocent man from death row based on the strength of their words alone, but said innocent man - Earl - is more often used as a pawn between the two of them in their game of divorcee cat-and-mouse, and it’s evident over the course of the film that Hildy, at least, is concerned with an exciting story above all else, often actively endangering Earl out of the belief that it’ll make her article more interesting. Walter, on the other hand, sees journalism as a means to an end, that being winning Hildy over. It’s a simultaneously optimistic and cynical view of the profession, painting the news itself as holding power for good, but the people involved as slaves to petty desires more often than not.</p>

                        <p><a href="nightcrawler.html">Nightcrawler:</a> In both films, the journalist directly manipulates and withholds evidence in order to have an exclusive story. This takes advantage of vulnerable subjects, and puts people at risk by waiting to expose a criminal until “the right moment.” Reporter Hildy and editor Walter are divorced, which only adds to the manipulation present in their newsroom. Walter plays tricks on Hildy to get her to stay at the paper, and ultimately, return to him as a partner. Similarly, in Nightcrawler, videographer Lou flirts with and attempts to extort sexual favors from the news director he sells his footage to. Both times, the films’ female leads fall for their tactics.
                            It appears much more sinister in the 2014 film, whereas it’s played for laughs in His Girl Friday.</p>
                        <p><a href="lee.html">Lee:</a> 2023’s period piece Lee is set in the 1940s and also features a female protagonist. Lee Miller was a model turned acclaimed World War II correspondent and photojournalist for Vogue Magazine. Conversely, she spends the entire film fighting for equity and respect inside what is widely considered “male” territory: the war effort. Although not as ruthless as the battlefield, reporting and journalism was also majorly seen as a man’s job. Despite this, in His Girl Friday, Hildy doesn’t have to do much to earn the respect of Walter’s newsroom. Several decades in the future, films like All the President’s Men (1976) and Spotlight (2015) still depicted women as secretaries and librarians more than they were reporters.</p>
