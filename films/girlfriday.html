                            <h2>About the Film</h2>
                            <p>Inspired by 1928 screenplay The Front Page, His Girl Friday becomes a meditation on gender dynamics more than anything by transforming the originally male-envisioned secondary lead, Hildy, into a woman. Walter’s desire to win his partner back is recontextualized as an inherently romantic move, and the movie becomes a romantic comedy almost devoid of real romance. Gestures of chivalry, as Farran Smith Nehme notes in her essay His Girl Friday: The Perfect Remarriage for the Criterion Collection, are near-absent, which sets it drastically apart from other romance films made at the same time. In general, the overarching impact His Girl Friday has had on both the journalism and film scenes is a willingness to challenge the misogyny of the newsroom; implicitly shaping many of the films about journalism that would follow it.</p>

                            <h2>Journalistic Themes</h2>
                            <p>In His Girl Friday, journalism is both a constructive and destructive force. Walter and Hildy are capable of liberating an innocent man from death row based on the strength of their words alone, but said innocent man - Earl - is more often used as a pawn between the two of them in their game of divorcee cat-and-mouse, and it’s evident over the course of the film that Hildy, at least, is concerned with an exciting story above all else, often actively endangering Earl out of the belief that it’ll make her article more interesting. Walter, on the other hand, sees journalism as a means to an end, that being winning Hildy over. It’s a simultaneously optimistic and cynical view of the profession, painting the news itself as holding power for good, but the people involved as slaves to petty desires more often than not.</p>
