                            <h2>About the Film</h2>
                            <p><i>Nightcrawler</i> is a darkly comedic crime thriller directed by Dan Gilroy that captures the fictional rise of Louis Bloom, a sociopathic criminal turned video journalist who goes to morally questionable lengths to climb up the ladder and deliver graphic videos to a struggling news company. The film portrays the modern journalist as a parasite who sensationalizes violence for monetary gain.</p>

                            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                            <p><i>Nightcrawler</i> is influenced by the history of photojournalism and its exploitation of crime for viewership. Lou Bloom, the protagonist’s, character is inspired by the photographer Weegee of the 1930’s 40’s. Weegee, Arthur Fellig, specialized in taking graphic photography of New York City crime scenes. Fellig, similar to Bloom, was a freelance photographer who was known for being able to arrive at crime scenes shortly after they occurred. Wegee gained controversy for consistently seeking out tragedy to portray graphic events similar to the controversy Bloom brings to the newsroom with his graphic videography.</p>
                            <p><i>Nightcrawler</i> displays this intrusive style of journalism amidst the contemporary of the 2010s. The film comments on modern media’s drive to sensationalize fear for ratings through Bloom’s depiction as a modern, fictionalized Weegee influenced by this new landscape of journalism. Bloom’s character is also a satire of the rise and grind mindset of the time. Heavily influenced by online business culture, he goes to extraordinary lengths to advance through society without minding ethical guidelines. This mindset manifests itself in Bloom's sociopathic nature where all of his relationships become business transactions. He crosses personal boundaries with everyone he interacts with seeing them as tools to get what he wants rather than fellow human beings.</p>

                            <h2>Contrasting Films: <i>Spotlight</i> and <i>All the President's Men</i></h2>
                            <p>It’s very telling to compare and contrast this film with its close contemporary, Spotlight, and one of Spotlight’s clearest sources of inspiration, All the President’s Men. The real journalists, as they’re portrayed in those two films, embody the classic Hollywood journalist character archetype. Lou Bloom, however, fits into a different category. Out of all the films on this list, Nightcrawler takes the closest look at journalism as a business and an industry; so Lou, in stark contrast with the honestly motivated characters of some of the other films, is a clear satire of the rise and grind mindset that was gaining popularity among men at the time and has been ever since.</p>
