                            <p>Nightcrawler is a thriller(dark comedy, drama) directed by Dan Gilroy that captures the fictional rise of Louis Bloom, a criminal turned video journalist who goes to morally questionable lengths to climb up the ladder and deliver graphic videos to a struggling news company.  </p>

                            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                            <p>Nightcrawler captures the contemporary landscape of media practice and consumer culture as well as the struggles of unemployment and the consequences of capitalism on the working class. Based on this setting they detail Louis Bloom, the protagonist as an anti-hero representative of advancement in American society despite adverse conditions. On the other hand Bloom represents greed in the industry as he is willing to reach his journalistic goals through intrusive means and even breaks the law to get certain shots. The film also details exploitation under capitalism exemplified by the character Rick and his relationship with Louis. Rick, who is desperate for a job, is forced to work under uncomfortable conditions and become an accomplice to illegal acts in order to make ends meet. The film makes commentary on the contemporary media and its relationship to the consumer in that our susceptibility to the sensationalization of fear and media contributes to this type of media behavior. This is exemplified by the demands that Nina places on Louis to get footage that will make headlines. Specifically, she calls Louis to capture crime in suburban instead of urban communities. Lastly the film makes commentary on the competitive nature of video journalists and warns of the potential consequences of this through the dramatization of Bloom and Loder. Bloom and Loder are constantly competing against each other to be the first at every scene throughout the film. This competition turns violent when Bloom sabotages Loder’s van in order to take him out of the industry. A historical figure that gave inspiration for this film was the photographer Weegee of the 1930’s 40’s. Weegee, Arthur Fellig, specialized in taking graphic photography of New York City crime scenes. Arthur, similar to Louis, was a freelance photographer who was known for being able to arrive at crime scenes shortly after they occurred.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Photojournalism that is deemed as heroic</li>
                                <li>Meant to honour the tragedy of events rather than sensationalize them</li>
                                <li>The way we can use this in the timeline is that this is the film that takes the closest look at journalism as a business and an industry. Content is selected by the news stations not based on what information needs to get out, but by where they know the money is coming from. I think this idea and the contrast with the other films is most exemplified in the scene where Nina yells at Lou that the horrible things happening in marginalized communities are irrelevant when it comes to making money. This creates good contrast with the much less cynical portrayals of journalists found in spotlight and all the president’s men, where the reporters are motivated to spread the truth by the positive impact spreading that truth will have</li>
