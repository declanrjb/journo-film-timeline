                            <h2>About the Film</h2>
                            <p>Nightcrawler is a darkly comedic crime thriller directed by Dan Gilroy that captures the fictional rise of Louis Bloom, a sociopathic criminal turned video journalist who goes to morally questionable lengths to climb up the ladder and deliver graphic videos to a struggling news company. The film portrays the modern journalist as a parasite who sensationalizes violence for monetary gain.</p>

                            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
                            <p>Nightcrawler is influenced by the history of photojournalism and its exploitation of crime for viewership. It captures the contemporary landscape of media practice and consumer culture as well as the struggles of unemployment and the consequences of capitalism on the working class. Based on this setting they detail Lou Bloom, a criminal turned photojournalist who goes to extraordinary lengths to take videos of graphic crimes.</p>
                            <p>Bloom’s character is inspired by the photographer Weegee of the 1930’s 40’s. Weegee, Arthur Fellig, specialized in taking graphic photography of New York City crime scenes. Fellig, similar to Bloom, was a freelance photographer who was known for being able to arrive at crime scenes shortly after they occurred. Wegee gained controversy for consistently seeking out tragedy to portray graphic events similar to the controversy Bloom brings to the newsroom with his graphic videography.</p>
                            <p>Bloom represents greed in the industry as he is willing to reach his journalistic goals through intrusive means and even breaks the law to get certain shots. His character makes a commentary on the contemporary capitalist who thrives off of the suffering of others and pursues success at the cost of moral consideration.</p>
                            <p>The film makes commentary on the contemporary media and its relationship to the consumer in that our susceptibility to the sensationalization of fear and media contributes to this type of media behavior. Nightcrawler amplifies the need for the news to portray ethically questionable and disturbing events to suburban populations in order to increase ratings.</p>

                            <h2>Contrasting Films: <i>Spotlight</i> and <i>All the President's Men</i></h2>
                            <p>It’s very telling to compare and contrast this film with its close contemporary, Spotlight, and one of Spotlight’s clearest sources of inspiration, All the President’s Men. The real journalists, as they’re portrayed in those two films, embody the classic Hollywood journalist character archetype. Lou Bloom, however, fits into a different category. Out of all the films on this list, Nightcrawler takes the closest look at journalism as a business and an industry; so Lou, in stark contrast with the honestly motivated characters of some of the other films, is a clear satire of the rise and grind mindset that was gaining popularity among men at the time and has been ever since.</p>
