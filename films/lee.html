As the war progresses across Europe and England is eventually pulled in Lee progressively becomes more involved through her photography. Initially used to promote protective gear and other war efforts through Vogue, Lee ultimately pushed her way to the war front in France and finally Germany. Over the course of the film Lee’s photography grew and changed after experiencing the war and the violence, sexism, and mental toll that it brought.</p>
