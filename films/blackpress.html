                            <p>Spanning 170 years of American History, Stanley Nelson Jr.’s documentary <i>The Black Press</i> details the role of African American-operated newspapers as voices for their communities, spreading important news, events, and achievements in a time when mainstream media did not represent them.</p>
                            <p>Many of these papers were underfunded and relied heavily on circulation and readership. However, not being sponsored through advertisements from major companies allowed the papers to report on the topics they wanted. These papers were admittedly biased because they recognized the prejudice within white-operated newspapers and wanted to focus on the Black stories not being told by these sources. Despite financial burdens and public pushback, Black newspapers pushed forward, although many failed to find readership, several papers like <i>The Chicago Defender</i> and <i>The Pittsburgh Courier</i> had a large impact, reaching far beyond their home cities. They helped to unite Black communities across the country and were an instrumental part of major events such as The Great Migration and the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
